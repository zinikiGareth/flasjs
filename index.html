<h2>Second Example: Primes</h2>
Another classic in functional programming is the Sieve of Eratosothenes.
This is a method for finding prime numbers by starting off assuming that
every number could be prime and going through them one by one saying that the
"first" number is prime and that all subsequent numbers can only be prime
if they do not have it as a divisor.
<p>
More formally, we can write:
<pre>
primes = sieve [2..]
sieve (p:l) = p:sieve (filter (notp p) l)
notp p n = n % p != 0
</pre>
Obviously, this is going to produce an infinite list (since there is an
infinite number of primes).  To avoid generating an infinite number, the
test will simply "take" the first few:
<pre>
take 7 primes
</pre>
This requires defining a "standard library" to provide functions such as
<tt>filter</tt> and <tt>take</tt>.  These are fairly boring, except for the
use of a curried function as an argument to <tt>filter</tt>.
I chose to implement the curried function as a JavaScript function, albeit
one that is nested within another function.  The <tt>FLEval.curry</tt>
method takes the "actual function" to call (in this case <tt>notp</tt>),
the defined arity of the function (which can only really be inferred during
type checking, but as a human I'm filling that role and saying it's 2), and
then whatever arguments are already on hand (in this case the prime number to
check against).  Filter then just calls this "function" on the remaining
argument (the prospective element of the list) and expects to get a boolean
back: if true, the element is added to the "result list";
if false, it is discarded.
<p>
As before, I think the JavaScript basically speaks for itself, with a
similar translation.  For example, the main function for primes is defined
as follows:
<pre>
primes =
  construct 3 closures:
    c1 = CLOSURE(List.intsFrom, 2);
    c2 = CLOSURE(sieve, c1)
  and return c2
</pre>

<h2>First Commit: Fib</h2>
There are classic problems in functional programming and it seems to me
that the right place to start is to try and implement some of those.
<p>
One of my favorites is the fibonacci sequence because it has two interesting
properties: it is very, very easy to write in the obvious way; and that
implementation is seriously flawed.
<p>
So the objective for "Lesson 1" is to get a lazy version of of this code
running:
<p>
<pre>
fib 0 = 1
fib 1 = 2
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
</pre>
<p>
Obviously, we're not going to write a compiler (just yet) for that; we're
just going to try and get it manually working.  So, what does that look like?
<p>
Well, without descending into JavaScript just yet, this is really equivalent to something like the following:
<p>
<pre>
fib n =
  EVALUATE n
  IS n AN INTEGER?
    yes =>
      Is it 0?  yes => return 1
      Is it 1?  yes => return 1
      Otherwise, construct five closures:
        c1 = CLOSURE(-, n, 1);
	c2 = CLOSURE(fib, c1);
        c3 = CLOSURE(-, n, 2);
	c4 = CLOSURE(fib, c3);
	c5 = CLOSURE(+, c2, c4);
      and return c5
    no =>
      return an error object
</pre>
<p>
In this context, the statement <tt>EVALUATE n</tt> means to iterate until you have
an actual value: any time the expression has a head which is a "closure" or
other intermediate form, it needs to be evaluated by calling the function
in the first part with the remaining arguments.  Note that BECAUSE this is
lazy evaluation, it is up to the function being called to decide if and when
any arguments will be evaluated.
<p>
I claim almost all the rest of the logic can be determined by a perusal
of <tt>testfib.js</tt>.  I'm sure this can be run in a browser, but I've been testing
this using iojs on the command line.
<p>
Most of the plumbing at this point is just manipulating things, for example,
defining the <tt>plus</tt> function to do the add operation as a function.
<tt>FLError</tt>
and <tt>FLClosure</tt> are just types to support errors and closures.
<p>
The head method is responsible for doing "head" evaluation of a closure.
Obviously, if it has already been head evaluated then it just returns the
value; otherwise it attempts to evaluate it.  To handle "tail recursion" a
loop is used to allow any method to return a closure which will again be
evaluated (so as to avoid infinite depth of recursion).
